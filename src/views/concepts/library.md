# Component Library

### Applicability of Component Library

> **Component library** is a collection of common components.

When we are working on a certain project, we usually put the common components in the project in one place for unified management. This is the **project level** component library.

As the number of a product project increases, in order to ensure the consistency of interactive visuals and reduce development costs, it is necessary to extract common components from these projects and place them in separate warehouses for unified management. This is the **product level** component library.

There are always some components between multiple products with similar interaction logic but large visual differences. We can also simplify the vision, retain the interaction logic and designed API, and form a prototype component library to facilitate the expansion of each product. This is a **cross-product level** component library.

Kubevue supports all the above three applicable levels of component libraries.
